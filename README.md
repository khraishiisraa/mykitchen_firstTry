# mykitchen_firstTry
web page for recipes first version 

a fully interactive kitchen recipes webpage! 🍳✨
Building this project helped me strengthen my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while having fun designing a smooth and engaging user

🧱 How It Works
🔹 1. Hero Section

Displays 3 images of the recipes.
Each image acts as a button that scrolls or jumps to the recipe section.

🔹 2. Recipe Section

Each recipe section includes:

A large recipe image

A clickable “Ingredients” title → shows/hides ingredient list

A clickable “Preparation” title → shows/hides cooking steps
